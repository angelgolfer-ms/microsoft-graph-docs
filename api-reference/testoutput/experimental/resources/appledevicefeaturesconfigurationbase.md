## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|airPrintDestinations|[airPrintDestination](../resources/airPrintDestination.md) collection|An array of AirPrint printers that should always be shown. This collection can contain a maximum of 500 elements.|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
