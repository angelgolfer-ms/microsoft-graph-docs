# androidWorkProfileWiFiConfiguration resource type

By providing the configurations in this profile you can instruct the Android Work Profile device to connect to desired Wi-Fi endpoint. By specifying the authentication method and security types expected by Wi-Fi endpoint you can make the Wi-Fi connection seamless for end user. This profile provides limited and simpler security types than Enterprise Wi-Fi profile.

## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|connectAutomatically|Boolean|Connect automatically when this network is in range. Setting this to true will skip the user prompt and automatically connect the device to Wi-Fi network.|
|connectWhenNetworkNameIsHidden|Boolean|When set to true, this profile forces the device to connect to a network that doesn't broadcast its SSID to all devices.|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|description|String|Admin provided description of the Device Configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode](../resources/deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode.md)|The device mode applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition](../resources/deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition.md)|The OS edition applicability for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion](../resources/deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion.md)|The OS version applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|displayName|String|Admin provided name of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|id|String| Inherited from [entity](../resources/entity.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|networkName|String|Network Name|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|List of Scope Tags for this Entity instance. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|ssid|String|This is the name of the Wi-Fi network that is broadcast to all devices.|
|supportsScopeTags|Boolean|Indicates whether or not the underlying Device Configuration supports the assignment of scope tags. Assigning to the ScopeTags property is not allowed when this value is false and entities will not be visible to scoped users. This occurs for Legacy policies created in Silverlight and can be resolved by deleting and recreating the policy in the Azure Portal. This property is read-only. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|wiFiSecurityType|Enumeration|Indicates whether Wi-Fi endpoint uses an EAP based security type. Possible values are: `open`, `wpaEnterprise`, `wpa2Enterprise`.|
