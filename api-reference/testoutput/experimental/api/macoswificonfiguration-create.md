# Create macOSWiFiConfiguration

Create a new [macOSWiFiConfiguration](../resources/macoswificonfiguration.md) object.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/concepts/permissions-reference.md).

|Permission type|Permissions (from most to least privileged)|
|:---|:---|

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application|**TODO: Determine AppOnly scopes **|

## HTTP Request
<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST ** Collection URI for microsoft.graph.macOSWiFiConfiguration not found
```

## Request headers
|Header|Value|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}|
|Content-Type|application/json|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation for the macOSWiFiConfiguration object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the macOSWiFiConfiguration.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String| Inherited from [entity](../resources/entity.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|List of Scope Tags for this Entity instance. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|supportsScopeTags|Boolean|Indicates whether or not the underlying Device Configuration supports the assignment of scope tags. Assigning to the ScopeTags property is not allowed when this value is false and entities will not be visible to scoped users. This occurs for Legacy policies created in Silverlight and can be resolved by deleting and recreating the policy in the Azure Portal. This property is read-only. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition](../resources/deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition.md)|The OS edition applicability for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion](../resources/deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion.md)|The OS version applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode](../resources/deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode.md)|The device mode applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|description|String|Admin provided description of the Device Configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|displayName|String|Admin provided name of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|networkName|String|Network Name|
|ssid|String|This is the name of the Wi-Fi network that is broadcast to all devices.|
|connectAutomatically|Boolean|Connect automatically when this network is in range. Setting this to true will skip the user prompt and automatically connect the device to Wi-Fi network.|
|connectWhenNetworkNameIsHidden|Boolean|Connect when the network is not broadcasting its name (SSID). When set to true, this profile forces the device to connect to a network that doesn't broadcast its SSID to all devices.|
|wiFiSecurityType|Enumeration|Indicates whether Wi-Fi endpoint uses an EAP based security type. Possible values are: `open`, `wpaPersonal`, `wpaEnterprise`, `wep`, `wpa2Personal`, `wpa2Enterprise`.|
|proxySettings|Enumeration|Proxy Type for this Wi-Fi connection. Possible values are: `none`, `manual`, `automatic`.|
|proxyManualAddress|String|IP Address or DNS hostname of the proxy server when manual configuration is selected.|
|proxyManualPort|Int32|Port of the proxy server when manual configuration is selected.|
|proxyAutomaticConfigurationUrl|String|URL of the proxy server automatic configuration script when automatic configuration is selected. This URL is typically the location of PAC (Proxy Auto Configuration) file.|
|preSharedKey|String|This is the pre-shared key for WPA Personal Wi-Fi network.|



## Response
If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [macOSWiFiConfiguration](../resources/macoswificonfiguration.md) object in the response body.
