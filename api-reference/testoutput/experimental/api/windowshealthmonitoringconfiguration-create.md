The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the windowsHealthMonitoringConfiguration.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String| Inherited from [entity](../resources/entity.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|List of Scope Tags for this Entity instance. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|supportsScopeTags|Boolean|Indicates whether or not the underlying Device Configuration supports the assignment of scope tags. Assigning to the ScopeTags property is not allowed when this value is false and entities will not be visible to scoped users. This occurs for Legacy policies created in Silverlight and can be resolved by deleting and recreating the policy in the Azure Portal. This property is read-only. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition](../resources/deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition.md)|The OS edition applicability for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion](../resources/deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion.md)|The OS version applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode](../resources/deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode.md)|The device mode applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|description|String|Admin provided description of the Device Configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|displayName|String|Admin provided name of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceConfiguration.md)|
|allowDeviceHealthMonitoring|Enumeration|Enables device health monitoring on the device. Possible values are: `notConfigured`, `enabled`, `disabled`.|
|configDeviceHealthMonitoringScope|Enumeration|Specifies set of events collected from the device where health monitoring is enabled. Possible values are: `undefined`, `healthMonitoring`, `bootPerformance`, `userExperienceAnalytics`.|
|configDeviceHealthMonitoringCustomScope|String|Specifies custom set of events collected from the device where health monitoring is enabled|



## Response
If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [windowsHealthMonitoringConfiguration](../resources/windowshealthmonitoringconfiguration.md) object in the response body.
